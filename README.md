BitWeb
======

A serverless webpage serving architecture 

BitWeb consists of two major components:
*  An http server based host (to support standard web consumers)
*  A local proxy for advanced consumers

BitWeb is built on top of Bittorrent Sync (although an alternative distributed hashtable mechanism could be used in its place).
